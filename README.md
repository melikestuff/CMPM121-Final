## Tools and materials

# Engine: Godot
We chose Godot because we wanted to learn a new game engine for upcoming game projects for future courses.
# Language: GDscript
The Godot Engine uses its own script called GDscript.
# Tools
We are going to use Github Desktop to help us with version control and manage who contributed what to the project.
Aesprite for pixel art due to its ease of use and accessibility.
Tiled to make tile maps in case we need to make a tile-based game.

## Outlook
Were hoping to accomplish making our own physics in Godot engine without using their built in functions.
We believe the hardest part of the project is coordinating what everyone is doing to build our project.
Were hoping to learn teamwork and a new game engine in the process.
